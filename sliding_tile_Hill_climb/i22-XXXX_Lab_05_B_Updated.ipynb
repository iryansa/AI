    "### **Start State (Given)**\n",

    "    [1, 2, 3, 4],\n",
    "    [5, 6, 0, 8],\n",

    "*     Sequence of moves required to reach the goal (e.g., \"Move tile 7 left\").\n",
    "*     Final grid configuration after applying the moves.\n",

    "### **Constraints:**\n",
    "1.    You can only move the empty space (0) to adjacent positions (up, down, left, right).\n",
    "2.    The goal is to minimize the number of moves to reach the solved state.\n",
    "3.    **Heuristic Function:** The Manhattan distance between each tileâ€™s current position and its goal position. The Manhattan distance for each tile is the sum of the horizontal and vertical distance between its current and goal positions.\n"
