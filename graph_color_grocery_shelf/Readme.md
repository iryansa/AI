# Graph Coloring and Grocery Store Shelf Optimization

## Overview

This repository contains solutions for two optimization problems:

1. **Graph Coloring using Local Beam Search**
2. **Grocery Store Shelf Optimization using Genetic Algorithm (GA)**

## Problem 1: Graph Coloring using Local Beam Search

### Problem Statement

Given an undirected graph **G(V, E)**, assign colors to each vertex while satisfying:

1. No two adjacent vertices share the same color.
2. Minimize the number of colors used (Chromatic Number Constraint).

### Additional Constraints

- **Degree-Based Coloring:** Higher-degree vertices are assigned colors first.
- **Pre-Assigned Colors:** Some vertices have predefined colors that must remain unchanged.
- **Balanced Color Usage:** The number of vertices per color should be approximately equal.
- **Distance Constraint:** Certain vertices must have different colors even if they are two hops apart.

### Approach

The **Local Beam Search** algorithm is used for solving this problem:

1. **State Representation:** Each state represents a color assignment for all vertices.
2. **Initial State:** A random valid coloring satisfying pre-assigned colors.
3. **Successor Generation:**
   - Recolor vertices while maintaining constraints.
   - Prioritize high-degree vertices to reduce conflicts.
4. **Heuristic Function:** Evaluates the best states based on constraints.

### Dataset

The solution is tested on the **hypercube\_dataset.txt**, which includes heuristics under additional constraints.

## Problem 2: Grocery Store Shelf Optimization using Genetic Algorithm

### Problem Statement

Optimize shelf space allocation in a grocery store to:

- Maximize space utilization.
- Ensure quick access to high-demand products.
- Enhance customer shopping experience.

### Constraints Considered

1. **Shelf Capacity & Weight Limit** â€“ Each shelf has a maximum weight limit.
2. **High-Demand Product Accessibility** â€“ Frequently bought items should be at eye level.
3. **Product Category Segmentation** â€“ Similar products should be placed together.
4. **Perishable vs. Non-Perishable Separation** â€“ Perishables require refrigeration.
5. **Hazardous and Allergen-Free Zones** â€“ Dangerous items must be stored separately.
6. **Product Compatibility and Cross-Selling** â€“ Complementary products should be placed nearby.
7. **Restocking Efficiency** â€“ Heavy items should be on lower shelves.
8. **Refrigeration Efficiency** â€“ Maximize refrigerator usage before opening a new one.
9. **Promotional and Discounted Items Visibility** â€“ Place offers in highly visible areas.
10. **Theft Prevention** â€“ Secure high-value items in visible or locked sections.

### Approach

The **Genetic Algorithm (GA)** is used to generate an optimal shelving plan:

1. **Population Initialization:** Random valid shelving arrangements.
2. **Fitness Function:** Evaluates solutions based on constraint satisfaction.
3. **Selection:** Top candidates are chosen for crossover.
4. **Crossover & Mutation:** Generates new solutions by combining existing ones.
5. **Termination Criteria:** Stops when an optimal/near-optimal shelving plan is achieved.

### Output

The optimized shelf allocation results are stored in an **Excel sheet** for better visualization.
